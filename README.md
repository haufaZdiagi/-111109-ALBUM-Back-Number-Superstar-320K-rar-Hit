Super Star is a 12-track album that showcases the band's versatility and maturity as musicians. The album opens with "Hanabira", a gentle acoustic ballad that expresses the nostalgia and longing for a lost love. The song features Shimizu's soothing vocals and delicate guitar work, creating a warm and sentimental atmosphere. The second track, "Super Star ni Nattara", is a contrast to the first one, as it is a fast-paced rock song that depicts the ambition and frustration of a young musician who wants to become a superstar. The song has a catchy chorus and a powerful guitar solo, demonstrating the band's rock skills.
     
The album continues with a variety of songs that explore different themes and genres, such as "Hanataba", a pop-rock song that celebrates the joy of love; "Omoidasenaku Naru Sono Hi Made", a punk-rock song that expresses the anger and resentment towards a cheating partner; "Ayashii Hikari", a folk-rock song that reflects on the uncertainty and anxiety of life; "Hantoumei Ningen", a funk-rock song that deals with the alienation and loneliness of being invisible; "Check no One Piece", a country-rock song that tells the story of a girl who wears a checkered dress to impress her crush; "Mr. Perfect", a blues-rock song that mocks the arrogance and hypocrisy of a self-proclaimed perfect man; "Kobore Ochite", a soft-rock song that describes the sadness and regret of letting go of someone; "Ritz Party", a disco-rock song that invites the listener to dance and have fun; "Densha no Mado Kara", a pop-rock song that captures the nostalgia and hope of seeing someone again; and "Shiawase", a piano-ballad that expresses the gratitude and happiness of being alive.

Super Star is an album that showcases Back Number's musical talent and diversity, as well as their ability to convey various emotions through their songs.
